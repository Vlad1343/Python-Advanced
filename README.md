# Python-Advanced

This repository contains experiments and small projects exploring advanced Python concepts and libraries. It is a work-in-progress for learning and practicing new Python skills.

## Topics & Libraries Explored

- **Email Handling:** Sending and reading emails using `smtplib`, `imapclient`, and `pyzmail`.  
- **Security:** Handling passwords securely with `getpass`.  
- **GUI Automation:**  
  - Controlling the keyboard and mouse using `pyautogui`.  
  - Automate repetitive tasks like filling out forms, pressing buttons, and navigating applications.  
  - Use screen color checks and screenshots to help the program stay on track.  
  - Best practice: make programs fail quickly on invalid instructions to prevent unintended actions.  
  - Simulate human-like actions and watch the mouse move while text appears automatically.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to gradually build experience with advanced Python functionality, including:

- Automation of repetitive tasks on your computer  
- Email interaction and handling  
- Secure handling of sensitive information  

New projects and experiments will be added over time as skills progress.
