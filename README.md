# Python-Advanced

This repository contains experiments and projects exploring advanced Python concepts and libraries. It is a work-in-progress for learning and practicing new Python skills.

---

## Topics & Libraries Explored

- **Email Handling:** Sending and reading emails using `smtplib`, `imapclient`, and `pyzmail`.  
- **Security:** Handling passwords securely with `getpass`.  
- **GUI Automation:**  
  - Controlling the keyboard and mouse using `pyautogui`.  
  - Automate repetitive tasks like filling out forms, pressing buttons, and navigating applications.  
  - Use screen color checks and screenshots to help the program stay on track.  
  - Best practice: make programs fail quickly on invalid instructions to prevent unintended actions.  
  - Simulate human-like actions and watch the mouse move while text appears automatically.  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:**  
  - Analyze COVID-19 datasets using `pandas`.  
  - Visualize global confirmed, recovered, and death cases with interactive Plotly charts.  
  - Enhanced visualizations with styled pie/donut charts, annotations, and color-coded segments.

## Projects Included

### GUI Automation Projects

- Python automation bot for **Sushi Go Round**: detects customer orders in real time, manages ingredient inventory, and prepares sushi automatically by interacting with the game interface.  

### Data Analysis Projects

- **COVID-19 Global Analysis with Plotly:**  
  - Reads time-series CSV datasets for confirmed, recovered, and death cases.  
  - Computes total active, recovered, and dead cases.  
  - Generates an interactive donut chart with custom styling for better visual insights.  
  - Produces an HTML chart file for sharing or embedding.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to gradually build experience with advanced Python functionality, including:

- Automation of repetitive tasks on your computer  
- Email interaction and handling  
- Secure handling of sensitive information  
- Data analysis and interactive visualization  

New projects and experiments will be added over time as skills progress.
